## create-react-app-light

### If you are a begginer 
You probably used create-react-app for your projects and had no idea which dependency doing what or got lost in scripts folder. How many time you've a encounter an error and had no idea where it came from and why ?

### If you are a master 
How many time you tried to kick off a project and waisted a lot of time setting up lint ? babel ? jest config ? 
or got stock with configuration errors? 

### If you are a pro
You probably own your nice boilerplate with your own tricks and style. But still, why won't you take a look and raise enhancements, PRS or issues ?


Instead of using the original create-react-app, this is a boilerplate to build a frontend app as tiny and basic as possible using react-redux.
